<h2>Software Engineer / Student</h2>
<p>
    As a very passionate software engineer, I am certain that I can be of great
    value to your team. I am excellent at developing full stack applications
    that takes advantage of distributed micro-service architectures and use an
    interactive dynamic website/GUI application for the front-end. I have a
    strong understanding of the Python programming language and regularly use
    data structures in my code to help keep my code clean and organized. I have
    used both Heroku and AWS cloud services for various projects of mine. I use
    Git frequently to keep my code synced up between my computers so I am very
    familiar with branches and making pull requests.
